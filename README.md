# pc98-serial-hdd-emulator

A two-parts projects that allows bootstraping a PC-9801 to a 16 bits OS by simulating a fixed disk drive.

The simulated disk drive data is read from a modern computer running a simple Python program.

The goal of this project is to reach a bit more capable than the BASIC interpreter to test and fix those machines.
